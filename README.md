# Wanderlust

## Overview

**Wanderlust** is a feature-rich web application designed to inspire travel and exploration, providing users with interactive listings and destination information. The project demonstrates modern web development techniques and best practices, using a robust tech stack and a well-structured codebase.

- **Live Demo:** [Visit Wanderlust](https://major-project-9owe.onrender.com/listings)

## Tech Stack & Techniques

### Languages & Frameworks

- **JavaScript:** Main programming language for application logic and server-side code (Node.js).
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript):** Templating engine for rendering dynamic HTML pages.
- **CSS:** Styling the application for responsive and appealing user interfaces.

### Core Techniques

- **RESTful APIs:** Routes and controllers are structured to follow RESTful conventions, making the backend scalable and easy to maintain.
- **MVC Architecture:** The project is organized using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern:
  - **Models:** Define and manage application data and schemas.
  - **Views:** EJS templates for rendering data to the user.
  - **Controllers:** Handle business logic and link models with views.
- **Middleware:** Custom and third-party middleware enhance security, request validation, and error handling.
- **Cloud Integration:** Use of cloudConfig.js suggests integration with cloud services (e.g., for storage or environment management).
- **Utility Functions:** Shared logic is abstracted into reusable utilities for maintainability.
- **Static Assets:** The `public` directory serves static files (images, CSS, client-side JS).
- **Package Management:** Managed via `npm` with dependencies listed in package.json.

## Folder Structure
